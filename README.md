# Sepsis-Prediction-using-ML
This project implements a complete machine learning pipeline to predict the onset of sepsis in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients using their clinical time-series data. The goal is to build and evaluate a robust classification model that can serve as an early warning system for this life-threatening condition.
